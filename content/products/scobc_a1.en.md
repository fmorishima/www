	The SC-OBC MODULE A1 board is optimized for use in CubeSats. We use technology cultivated by JAXA for reliable, safe use on the International Space Station. These boards use a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA, allowing flexible configuration and multiple interface options. Not limited to CubeSats, our boards can also benefit other spacecraft and even terrestrial applications here on Earth.
