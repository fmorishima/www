{% product_overview(img="sc-obc_module_a1.png", alt="", title="SC-OBC Module A1", subtitle="Space computer module for ultra-small satellites") %}

The SC-OBC MODULE A1 board is optimized for use in CubeSats. We use
technology cultivated by JAXA for reliable, safe use on the
International Space Station. These boards use a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA,
allowing flexible configuration and multiple interface options. Not
limited to CubeSats, our boards can also benefit other spacecraft and
even terrestrial applications here on Earth.
