― In-Orbit Demonstration of the In-House Space Computer “SC-OBC Module A1” aboard 3U CubeSat “SC-Sat1a” ―

September 4, 2025<br>
Space Cubics Inc.

Space Cubics Inc. (Headquarters: Sapporo, Hokkaido, CEO: Yasushi Shoji,
hereinafter “Space Cubics”), a developer of space-grade computers, is
pleased to announce that it has signed a Launch Services Agreement (LSA)
with Space One Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Minato-ku, Tokyo), which develops
and operates the small satellite launch vehicle “Kairos.”
Under this agreement, Space Cubics plans to launch its proprietary 3U
CubeSat “SC-Sat1a” aboard the Kairos Rocket No. 3. The mission will
demonstrate the fault tolerance and reliability of the company’s
space-grade onboard computer, the “SC-OBC Module A1,” through long-term
in-orbit operation.

The SC-OBC Module A1 is an onboard computer optimized for CubeSats,
developed based on the reliable design technology cultivated by the Japan
Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) aboard the International Space Station
(ISS).
Equipped with a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA, the computer provides scalability and
flexible interface compatibility despite its compact size.
For this mission, two units of the SC-OBC Module A1 will be mounted on
SC-Sat1a to handle satellite control. Long-term in-orbit operation will
validate the computer’s fault-tolerant functions, including radiation
resistance, redundancy design, and failover mechanisms.
Through this demonstration, Space Cubics aims to establish the SC-OBC
Module A1 as the de facto standard for CubeSat onboard computers in the
future.

Founded in 2018, Space Cubics is a JAXA-certified venture company that has
accumulated extensive experience in developing rugged computers for
spacecraft such as satellites, exploration probes, and space robotics.
With this mission, the company seeks to further strengthen the reliability
and flight heritage of its space-grade computer technology.
