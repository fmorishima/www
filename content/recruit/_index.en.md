Space Cubics, Inc. was founded by engineers who met while working in
various space tech fields. We genuinely enjoy engineering computers
that can be used in the harsh, extreme environment of space.

Some of us are experts in spacecraft, others in computer circuits, and
still others in software development â€” but we are all skilled at what
we do. Some engineering problems require teamwork, making every day a
group effort. We don't observe a traditional top-down management
structure because we are all unique individuals who achieve more when
working together.

Space Cubics is young and still growing. If you are interested in the
astrocomputer industry, please reach out to us. But if you don't work
well in a positive, collaborate environment, then this may not be the
best place for you.
