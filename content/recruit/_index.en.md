 Space Cubics, Inc. was founded by engineers who met while working in various space tech fields. We genuinely enjoy engineering computers that can be used in the harsh, extreme environment of space.
<br><br>
 Some of us are experts in spacecraft, others in computer circuits, and still others in software development â€” but we are all skilled at what we do. Some engineering problems require teamwork, making every day a group effort. We don't observe a traditional top-down management structure because we are all unique individuals who achieve more when working together.
 <br><br>
Space Cubics is young and still growing. If you are interested in the astrocomputer industry, please reach out to us. But if you don't work well in a positive, collaborate environment, then this may not be the best place for you."
